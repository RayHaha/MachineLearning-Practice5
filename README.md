linear regression

It's the question 13 from machine learning course https://www.csie.ntu.edu.tw/~htlin/course/ml15fall/hw3/hw3.pdf

Carry out Linear Regression without transformation, i.e., with feature vector:
(1, x1, x2),
to find wlin, and use wlin directly for classification. Run the experiments for 1000 times and plot
a histogram on the classification (0/1) in-sample error (Ein). What is the average Ein over 1000
experiments?
Now, transform the training data into the following nonlinear feature vector:
(1, x1, x2, x1x2, x21, x22)
Find the vector Ëœw that corresponds to the solution of Linear Regression, and take it for classification.
